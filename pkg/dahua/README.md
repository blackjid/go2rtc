# Dahua P2P

Reverse-engineered implementation of the P2P transport Dahua/KBVision devices
use to reach the easy4ip cloud, carrying an ordinary RTSP session over a
NAT-punched UDP socket.

```
dh/      cloud protocol: UDP client, DH-HTTP, WSSE auth, device crypto, handshake
ptcp/    PTCP packet framing and session counters
tunnel/  TCP-over-PTCP realms, exposed as net.Conn
```

This package owns no logger. `Config.Trace` and `Config.Error` are wired by
`internal/dahua`; while nil, nothing is formatted.

## Handshake

Four parties: this client, Dahua's main server, a relay agent, and the device.

| Step | Request | To | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DHGET /probe/p2psrv` | `easy4ipcloud.com:8800` | discover infrastructure |
| 2 | `DHGET /online/p2psrv/{serial}` | main server | P2P server for this device |
| 3 | `DHGET /probe/device/{serial}` | P2P server | confirm device online |
| 4 | `DHGET /info/device/{serial}` | P2P server | encrypted info (randsalt, RTSP port) |
| 5 | `DHPOST /device/{serial}/p2p-channel` | main server | request channel, AES-encrypted local address |
| 6 | `DHGET /relay/agent` | relay server | agent address and token |
| 7 | `DHGET /relay/start/{token}` | agent | start agent session |
| 8 | read step 5 response | main server | device public and local addresses |
| 9 | `DHPOST /device/{serial}/relay-channel` | main server | authorize the agent |
| 10 | PTCP SYNC | agent | establish agent session |
| 11 | command `0x17` | agent | obtain the **sign** |
| 12 | STUN-like exchange, SYNC, `0x19`/`0x1A`/`0x1B` | device | hole punch and authenticate |

Steps 6-11 exist only to obtain the sign; media never flows through the agent.
Step 12 is attempted 3 times, against the device's public and LAN addresses
simultaneously so a camera on the same network connects directly.

Relaying media through the agent is deliberately unsupported: it measured
slower and less reliable than direct P2P, and a silent fallback would hide a
NAT change the operator needs to see.

Devices with a per-device `randsalt` (all recent firmware) require
`key = MD5("user:Login to {randsalt}:pass")` uppercase, addresses encrypted
AES-OFB under `PBKDF2-SHA256(key, nonce, 20000)`, and each request signed with
`HMAC-SHA256(key, nonce ‖ date ‖ payload)`. Without valid credentials the
device answers the p2p-channel request with 403.

## PTCP

PTCP ("phony TCP") multiplexes connections over one UDP socket as *realms*.

```
┌──────────────────── Header (24 bytes) ─────────────────────┐
│ "PTCP" │ Sent(4) │ Recv(4) │ PID(4) │ LMID(4) │ RMID(4)    │
├──────────────────── Body (variable) ───────────────────────┤
│ Type(1) │ Length(3) │ Realm(4) │ Padding(4) │ Data(N)      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

`0x00` SYNC, `0x10` payload, `0x11` BIND, `0x12` status (`CONN`/`DISC`),
`0x13` heartbeat, `0x17`-`0x1B` handshake commands.

Two framing rules are load-bearing:

- **Every non-SYNC packet needs a unique PID.** The device dedupes on PID and
  silently discards repeats; when ACKs and heartbeats shared one, the device's
  view of our receive window froze and video stalled after 2-3s. PID is
  `0x0000FFFF - (count & 0xFFFF)`; the mask keeps the high half zero, which is
  how the device always sees it.
- **Send order must match LMID order.** `sendPacket` holds `sendMu` across both
  the counter update and the UDP write, because a packet arriving out of LMID
  order is dropped.

Payloads fragment at 1280 bytes, matching the official app and keeping the
datagram (24 + 12 + 1280) inside common MTUs.

## Measuring loss

Inbound headers carry the device's view of the conversation, so loss is
observable without a capture. `Tunnel.Stats` exposes it and the tunnel traces
it every 30s while realms are active:

```
ptcp counters sent=23314 peer_recv=23302 out_unacked=12 out_msgs=179
              recv=124174150 peer_sent=124172858 in_skew=-1292 realms=7
```

`out_unacked` returns to 0 in a healthy tunnel; sustained growth means the
device has stopped consuming what we send. That is the failure that precedes
a tunnel refusing every BIND, and it is invisible to inbound liveness checks
because the device keeps sending packets of its own throughout. The heartbeat
loop watches the same signal and rebuilds the tunnel after
`outboundStallTimeout`. `in_skew` is normally slightly *negative* — the device's snapshot
predates packets we already consumed — and sustained growth is inbound loss.
`out_msgs` settles at a steady non-zero lag because the device advances `RMID`
more slowly than we emit coalesced ACKs.

Measured over 124 MB across 7 realms the device acknowledged every byte sent,
which is why no retransmission layer is implemented. Revisit if `out_unacked`
is seen climbing on some other network.
